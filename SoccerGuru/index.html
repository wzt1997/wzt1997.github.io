            In 2020, we not only cheered for Bayern Munich’s winning the European Champian’s League but mourned for the
            unexpected passing away of Maradona. In 2020, we got accustomed to watching ‘silent’ soccer matches with no
            audience in the stadium. Last year, many tournaments and soccer leagues were postponed due to the epidemic.
            However, people’s passion for the sport
            does not fade at all.
        </p>

            As the acknowledged most popular sport in the world, soccer has long been playing a significant role in
            people’s life. Fans and journalists are delighted in asking interesting questions like who will be the best
            scorer in the Premier League? Which team will Messi transfer to? There are still many colorful and
            interesting stories to be dug from the statistics. To offer a better insight into the sport, we intend to
            resort to visualization tools to unmask some intriguing discoveries in the soccer world

                    players in 2019.
                    The data is provided by the dataset 'FIFA17 to FIFA21 statistics for each football player'.
                    This visualization is implemented by D3 and can be devided for mainly three parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Firstly, a filter is provided, with which users can select the player they are interested

                            And a radar chart will be generated based on the player's capabilities of six main aspects:
                            strength, speed, passing, shooting, dribbling and defense.
                            In addition, we also depict the average level of all players in the radar chart for
                            comparison.
                            All the statistics are calculated based on the dataset.

                    different tournaments from 2017 to 2020.

                        <li>For the selected player, we use a side-by-side bar chart comebined a line chart to
                            illustrate the performance of a player throught out the years.
                            If the player has taken taken part in more than one tournament, there will be more than one
                            bar mark for each year and legends should be generated automatically.
                            Apart from the bars, we also draw lines to show the change of performance of the players.
                            What's more, you can select the field of data that you are interested in for visualisation,
                            such as number of appearances, player raing and etc.

                            illustrate the player performance in more detail.
                            We are interested in five aspects for pie charts depiction: Shots, GoalPostions,
                            GoalMethods, Passes and DuelWon.

                    Each node in the network graph represents a team and each link represents the transfers in the selected year between the source node and the target node.

                    Chasing bar diagrams are adopted to demonstrate the value of the players, on the basis of their transfer fee. 
                    Each bar in the diagram represents the transfer fee of the player and the diagram shows the top 10 most valuable players in the year. 
                    The data is provided by the dataset 'European football player transfers' dataset.

                            Through animation, the diagram is updated at the annual rate. 
                            Each bar in the diagram represents one player and on the right of the bar, the total transfer fee will be demonstrated.

                        <li>The Line Chart: The line chart is designed to show the trend of the changes of the player through his career. 
                            The interactivity here is that when we click on the label or the bar of the player in the bar chart, the line chart will demonstrate the trend of the changes of past transfer fee from 1993 to 2020.

                    Sankey Diagram is adopted to demonstrate the transfer history between different teams in the selected year. 
                    A Sankey Diagram is a visualisation technique that allows to display flows. 
                    Several entities (nodes) are represented by rectangles or text. 
                    Their links are represented with arrows or arcs that have a width proportional to the importance of the flow. 
                    The data is provided by the dataset 'European football player transfers' dataset.

                        <li>The Filter: there are two filters in the sankey diagram, the first one is to choose the team to demonstrate the transfer information and the second one is to select the year.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Sankey Map: The sankey map is designed for the transfer history between different teams in the selected year. The entity in the left part of the map is the selected team and in the right part, there exists several teams that have transactions with the selected team in the selected year. The interactivity here is that when we hover on the line of the sankey map, it will show the exact number of the transfer players at that year.

                    Transfer History Map is adopted to demonstrate the transfer history of the selected player in his career. Each point on the map represents the location of a club and the link between them represents that the player has been transferred from the source club to the target one. The data is provided by the dataset 'European football player transfers' and ' Stadiums with GPS coordinates'. This visualization is implemented by echarts.js and can be divided for mainly two parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Filter: the filter in the Transfer History Map is to choose the player to demonstrate the transfer history over the years. 
                        </li>
                        <li>The Transfer History Map: The transfer history map is designed for the  transfer history of the selected player between different teams in his career. After we select the player in the filter, the map will show all the relevant clubs and connect them based on the transfer history. The animation demonstrates the transaction direction between the two clubs. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
