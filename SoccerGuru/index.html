            In 2020, we not only cheered for Bayern Munich’s winning the European Champian’s League but mourned for the
            unexpected passing away of Maradona. In 2020, we got accustomed to watching ‘silent’ soccer matches with no
            audience in the stadium. Last year, many tournaments and soccer leagues were postponed due to the epidemic.
            However, people’s passion for the sport
            does not fade at all.
        </p>

            As the acknowledged most popular sport in the world, soccer has long been playing a significant role in
            people’s life. Fans and journalists are delighted in asking interesting questions like who will be the best
            scorer in the Premier League? Which team will Messi transfer to? There are still many colorful and
            interesting stories to be dug from the statistics. To offer a better insight into the sport, we intend to
            resort to visualization tools to unmask some intriguing discoveries in the soccer world

                            And a radar chart will be generated based on the player's capabilities of six main aspects:
                            strength, speed, passing, shooting, dribbling and defense.
                            In addition, we also depict the average level of all players in the radar chart for
                            comparison.
                            All the statistics are calculated based on the dataset.

                    This visualization is designed to show the statistics based on the performance of players in
                    different tournaments from 2017 to 2020.
                    The data is provided by the dataset 'Players stats per season'.

                        <li>For the selected player, we use a side-by-side bar chart comebined a line chart to
                            illustrate the performance of a player throught out the years.
                            If the player has taken taken part in more than one tournament, there will be more than one
                            bar mark for each year and legends should be generated automatically.
                            Apart from the bars, we also draw lines to show the change of performance of the players.
                            What's more, you can select the field of data that you are interested in for visualisation,
                            such as number of appearances, player raing and etc.

                            We are interested in five aspects for pie charts depiction: Shots, GoalPostions,

    <div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="design" style="padding-top: 10px!important">
        <h2 class="w3-center">Design Choices</h2>
        <p>We first had to analyze and transform the data. It quickly became clear that the quality of the data left a
            lot to be desired.
            With the cleansed data, we first looked at how we could achieve our design goals described above.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Choosing the right visualization</h3>
        <p>We made different sketches and realized that the most understandable and clear presentation was a map that
            assigned different colors to countries given specific data ranges. Nevertheless, we had to keep in mind that
            there
            is only a certain number of colours that can be easily distinguished. Therefore, as soon as you move a mouse
            over the countries, they get a contour that indicates the exact size of the country. In addition, we decided
            to use a tooltip which, for example, shows the exact average rating of the players in a country.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Foundations Visual Design</h3>
        <p>Our initial goal was to visualise a quick overview of the FIFA player ratings for each country. Kagle's data
            set gave us information about the individual players and their origins. With this information we could
            concentrate ourselves on giving simple and quick information on which countries offer better players
            (alongside other possible criterias) rather than overflow the visualization with additional data.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Fundamental Principals of Analytical Design </h3>
        <p>Our visualization is dividede into two parts: One for the purposes of brushing the data, the other for the
            actual visualization and fast adjustment of a given criteria. The dimensions implemented require the
            following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Longitude & latitude to draw each individual country
            </li>
            <li>
                Color ratio to display differences in selected value
            </li>
            <li>
                Tooltip to allow for detail on demand & "Integration of Evidence"
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We have implemented several brushing & filter criterias. Without any settings done, the first overview will
            be the overal mean player rating. The color scale ranges from white (no data available) to a dark orange
            (darker = higher average). The color gradient is based on the data selected for display, which can be set
            just above the map itself. We set 8 different steps in this gradient since we thought that this offered the
            best deal out of seeing to little to too much differences.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Data-Ink Ratio</h3>
        <p>To maximize the efficiency of our visualization, we took good care of how big our visualizations are, how
            much space each individual information needs (e.g. our tooltip) and how much data is really needed. </p>
        <p>“A large share of ink on a graphic should present data-information, the ink changing as the data change.
            Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in
            the numbers represented.” Tufte, 1983</p>
        <p>When we designed our map we held the data-ink ratio as high as possible.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Human Perception</h3>
        <p>Whilst programming this website, we laid a big importance on the flow whilst reading and scrolling through
            the page. To enhance the engagement and visual attractiveness we settled for a "cool" website template,
            which suited our topic. </p>
        <p>Starting with a top navigation bar, clear instructions and informations about our data, and then followed by
            our visualization, we found a good approach on how the user is being guided through our project.The
            transition of actions is natural, causal and hierarchical.The visual changes, when filters are applied,
            further increase the interactivity.</p>
        <br />

        <h3>Interaction Concept</h3>
        <p>Our visualizations consist of brushing and filtering. As soon as the desired filters are being selected and
            the "Calculate" button is clicked, the data will be usable for further brushing. Once a country gets hovered
            over (brushing), the country gets highlighted and a tooltip appears with more information. As soon as the
            visitor changes the mouse position to another country, the tooltip and highlighting changes to the given
            country.</p>

        <p>When we transformed the data, we had different ideas about how best to visualize the data.
            For a better understanding we have integrated some of these sketches into our website.</p>

        <p>Due to the given time limit of this module, we didn't have the chance to visualize all of our conceptual
            work. However there are some neat implementations possible, as soon as a country is selected. Alternatively,
            we could have used more dimensions from the dataset provided to develop visualizations for indivual player
            or country averages based on certain skills, as shown above.</p>

        <p>To develop our d3 visualization we used different sources to build our knowledge:</p>
        <u>
            <li>https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/d3js</li>
            <li>https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/index.html</li>

        </u>
        <p>The general template of our website was contributed by Anja Zimmermann on <a

        </p>
        <p>As stated before, our dataset was retrieved from Kagle: <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19">Link to dataset</a></p>
        <p>We worked in close collaboration with the group of Maximilian Becker & Philippe Schwarzer - Some similarities
            might be discoverable :-)</p>

        <h4>What did we learn?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                How to search for an appropriat dataset & how important a clean data baseline is.
            </li>
            <li>
                How to develop visualisations with d3 from the start to the implementation.
            </li>
            <li>
                What the limits are and how time limits constrain our designing process.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What would we do better next time?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Focus on one or two visualisations rather than thinking in many approaches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a working prototype faster to further develop ideas.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spend more time learning the d3 library, since some of our approaches could have been developed way
                easier.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All in all, we learned a lot throughout the projects duration. Both of has have never used d3 before and we
            were inspired, since we didn't know that creating graphs using only JS, HTML & CSS would be that simple,
            given the time constraint.</p>
